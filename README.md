### usage:
`./rdio-blame.py <user_id || user_key>`

This is not currently very feature rich, but will show you the top 4 offenders per album in a users heavy rotation.

The command output will be formatted like so.  
$artist - $album   
  Name: "$user_display_name"  URL: $user_profile_url    
  Name: "$user_display_name"  URL: $user_profile_url    
  Name: "$user_display_name"  URL: $user_profile_url    
  Name: "$user_display_name"  URL: $user_profile_url
